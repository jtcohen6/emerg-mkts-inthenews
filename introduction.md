# Background: Emerging, Splurging, Purging #

_Examining emergent market ETFs via "predictive" financial news._

As we hack this, leaders and technocrats from around the world are meeting at the [World Economic Forum](http://www.weforum.org/) in Davos, Switzerland. While it may be ["high-altitude networking"](http://nyti.ms/1OsFHUO), there are real concerns about the future of globalist paradigms in finance and macroeconomic policy.

High-yield "junk" bonds, especially those from "emerging markets", experienced a sharp "correction" in late 2015. The investor jargon is useful to a point: asset classes, like skirt lengths, go up and down as a matter of fashion.

A slow-down in the once indefatigable Chinese economy, alongside decades-low commodity prices, seems poised to undermine older projections of the economic world to come. Voracious growth among developing ("emerging") countries---rich in natural resources and cheap labor, whether in South and Southeast Asia, the Gulf States, West Africa, or South America---cannot continue on 5+% GDP growth year over year.

Out of skeptical curiosity, though not cynicism, [we might consider possibilities](http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-is-the-post-post-davos-model-of-the-world): the globalized economic structure is undergoing a long-term stress test (whether "debt supercyle" or "secular stagnation"); or, the globalized _financial_ structure is more liable to the momentum of well-informed investor band-wagoning.
